Here in this post, I'll explain how to create a button to reset all filters in [Reactive Search](https://docs.appbase.io/docs/reactivesearch/v3/overview/quickstart/).

You already probably know the component [`<SelectedFilters />`](https://docs.appbase.io/docs/reactivesearch/v3/advanced/selectedfilters/) but this one doesn't only display a `clear all` button, it also creates a button on each filter selected.

To only display a reset button, it's quite easy. Just use the `render` method of [`<SelectedFilters />`](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch/blob/dev/packages/web/examples/CustomSelectedFilters/src/index.js#L27) which gives you two functions: `clearValues()` and `setValue(component, value)`, and use the one we want (`clearValues`), like that:

```js
class ReactiveClearAllFilters extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { ...rest } = this.props

    return (
      <SelectedFilters
        render={({ clearValues }) => (
          <button type="button" onClick={clearValues}>
            {"Reset"}
          </button>
        )}
        {...rest}
      />
    )
  }
}
```

💥, it's done!
